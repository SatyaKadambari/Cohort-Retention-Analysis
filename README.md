# Cohort-Retention-Analysis

This project is based on Super Store Data dataset. I have analyzed their data and tried to understand the customer's behaviour from this dataset. The main objective of this project is to perform Cohort Analysis. A cohort is a group of people with something in common and Cohort Analysis is an analysis of different cohorts to get a better understanding of behaviours,trends or patterns. There are 3 types of Cohort Analysis are : Time-Based, Size-Based, Segment-Based. I'm doing the time-based cohort analysis in this project.
I have used SSIS to pre-process and perfrom some basic data cleaning on the dataset. Once, I performed those actions using SSIS, I made to connection to my SSMS client and imported the data for further analysis.
I have used SQL to remove duplicates using window functions. Then I created the cohort indexes of the customer from the time they made their first purchase in the store.
This type of analysis helps the store the retention rate of the customers, value that customer adds to their sales and many more. I have used window functions, CTEs to make the data ready for analysis and then visualizing it. Created a Tableau Dashboard to display the results of the analysis. 
 
Here is the final Dashboard:
